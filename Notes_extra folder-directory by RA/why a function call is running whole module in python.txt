Q why a function call is running whole module in python
Q When I import my module in python, it automatically runs all of the
defined functions inside of it. How do I prevent it from auto executing
 my functions, but still allow me to call them in my main script?

A: If your module looks something like this:
def some_function():
	some_code()

def some_other_function():
	some_other_code()

some_more_code()
even_more_code()

# then some_more_code() and even_more_code() will run when you import the module.
# To avoid that, ue below code:
def some_function():
	some_code()

def some_other_function():
	some_other_code()

if __name__ == '__main__':
	some_more_code()
	even_more_code()
